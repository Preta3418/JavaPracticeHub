# Java Practice Hub ðŸ§ âœ¨

A collection of assorted practice projects written in **Java** and **Spring Boot**, designed to explore core language features, algorithms, and backend development through modular, testable, and extensible code.

This repository serves as a **central hub** where multiple projects â€” from CLI-based number analyzers to full web backends â€” can be launched individually through a simple interactive interface.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Practice Hub CLI**
  - A text-based main menu to navigate and run different modules
  - Currently includes: `Amazing Numbers`

- **Amazing Numbers**
  - Analyze numeric properties
  
    Buzz	number    : divisible by 7 or ends with 7.
    Duck number    : contains at least one zero (excluding leading zero).
    Palindromic	   : Reads the same backward and forward (e.g. 121, 1331).
    Gapful	        : 3 digits and divisible by the number formed by first and last digit.
    Spy	Sum        : digits equals product of digits (e.g. 123: 1+2+3 == 1Ã—2Ã—3).
    Sunny & Square : if n+1 is a perfect square. A number is square if itâ€™s a perfect square.
    Jumping	Digits : subsequent number differ by 1 (e.g. 123, 8987).
    Happy & Sad	    : numbers which eventually reach 1 when replaced by the sum of the squares of their digits is "happy". Otherwise, theyâ€™re "sad".
    Even & Odd
